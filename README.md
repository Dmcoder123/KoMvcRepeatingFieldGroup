KoMvcRepeatingFieldGroup
========================

An example of how to use my custom namepath binding to create an add form with repeating groups of fields within it, and then submit the resulting form to an MVC controller

Please note that this example is only a UI concept... look for the placeholder "// Do something with viewmodel here" to see where you need to pick up from. Put a breakpoint after this line and use the debug inspection tools to see that the model has been populated.
